Plaque is the accumulation of fat, cholesterol, and other\\nsubstances. As plaque continues to build up in the arteries, blood\\nflow to the heart is reduced.\\nHeart disease can lead to a heart attack. A heart attack happens\\nwhen an artery becomes totally blocked with plaque, preventing\\nvital oxygen and nutrients from getting to the heart. A heart attack\\ncan cause permanent damage to the heart muscle.\\nHeart disease is one of several cardiovascular diseases, which are\\ndisorders of the heart and blood vessel system. Other cardiovascular\\ndiseases include stroke, high blood pressure, and rheumatic heart\\ndisease.\\nSome people aren’t too concerned about heart disease because they\\nthink it can be “cured” with surgery. This is a myth.\\nHeart disease is a lifelong condition: Once you get it,\\nyou’ll always have it. It’s true that procedures such as\\nangioplasty and bypass surgery can help blood and\\noxygen flow more easily to the heart. But the arter-\\nies remain damaged, which means you are still more\\nlikely to have a heart attack. What’s more, the\\ncondition of your blood vessels will steadily\\nworsen unless you make changes in your\\ndaily habits and control your risk factors.\\nMany people die of complications\\nfrom heart disease, or become \\npermanently disabled.

They can also increase the chances that an\\nexisting disease will get worse. Important risk factors for heart dis-\\nease that you can do something about are cigarette smoking, high\\nblood pressure, high blood cholesterol, overweight, physical \\ninactivity, and diabetes. Recent research shows that more than \\n95 percent of those who die from heart disease have at least one \\nof these major risk factors.\\nCertain risk factors, such as getting older, can’t be changed. After\\nmenopause, women are more likely to develop heart disease. For\\nboth women and men, middle age is a time of increasing risk\\nbecause people are more likely to develop heart disease risk factors\\nduring this stage of life.\\nFamily history of early heart disease is another risk factor that can’t\\nbe changed. If your father or brother had a heart attack before age\\n55, or if your mother or sister had one before age 65, you are more\\nlikely to get heart disease.\\nWhile certain risk factors cannot be changed, it is important to \\nrealize that you do have control over many others. Regardless of\\nyour age or family history, you can take important steps to lower\\nyour risk of heart disease.\\nHow Risk Works\\nIt may be tempting to believe that doing just one healthy thing will\\ntake care of your heart disease risk. For example, you may hope\\nthat if you walk or swim regularly, you can still eat a lot of fatty\\nfoods and stay fairly healthy. Not true. To protect your heart, it is\\nvital to make changes that address each and every risk factor you\\nhave. You can make the changes gradually, one at a time. But mak-\\ning them is very important.\\nWhile each risk factor increases your risk of heart disease, having\\nmore than one risk factor is especially serious. That’s because risk\\nfactors tend to “gang up” and worsen each other’s effects. For\\nexample, if you have high blood cholesterol and you smoke, your\\nheart disease risk increases enormously. The message is clear: You\\nneed to take heart disease risk seriously, and the best time to reduce\\nthat risk is now.\\nYour Guide to a Healthy Heart'),\n",

Tell your doctor that you want to keep your\\nheart healthy and would like help in achieving that\\ngoal. Ask questions about your chances of\\ndeveloping heart disease and ways to lower\\nyour risk. (See “Questions To Ask Your\\nDoctor” on the next page.) Also ask for\\ntests that will determine your personal\\nrisk factors. (See “What’s Your Number?”\\non page 8.) \\nBe open.

However, your\\nbody makes all the cholesterol it needs. Over a period of years,\\nextra cholesterol and fat circulating in the blood build up in the\\nwalls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This buildup,\\ncalled plaque, makes the arteries narrower and narrower. As a\\nresult, less blood gets to the heart. Blood carries oxygen to the\\nheart; if enough oxygen-rich blood cannot reach your heart, you\\nmay suffer chest pain. If the blood supply to a portion of the heart\\nis completely cut off, the result is a heart attack.\\nCholesterol travels in the blood in packages called lipoproteins.\\nLDL carries most of the cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol pack-\\naged in LDL is often called bad cholesterol, because too high a level\\nof LDL in your blood can lead to cholesterol buildup and blockage\\nin your arteries.\\nAnother type of cholesterol is HDL, also called good cholesterol.\\nThat’s because HDL helps remove cholesterol from the body, \\npreventing it from building up in your arteries.\\n17Major Risk Factors'),\n",

These are the most commonly prescribed drugs for\\npeople who need a cholesterol-lowering medicine.

However, long-term use of these medicines is considered safe. \\nNiacin. Niacin, or nicotinic acid, lowers total cholesterol, LDL\\ncholesterol, and triglyceride levels, while also raising HDL \\ncholesterol. Niacin is available without a prescription, but it is\\nimportant to use it only under a doctor’s care because of possi-\\nble serious side effects.

Since 1991, the proportion \\nof Americans who are obese has soared by 75 percent.\\nOverweight among children is also swiftly increasing. Among young\\npeople ages 6–19, more than 16 percent are overweight, compared\\nto just 4 percent a few decades ago. This is a disturbing trend\\nbecause overweight adolescents have a greatly increased risk of\\ndying from heart disease in adulthood. Even our youngest citizens\\nare at risk. About 10 percent of preschoolers weigh more than is\\nhealthy for them.\\nOur national waistline is expanding for two simple reasons—we are\\neating more and moving less. Americans consume about 200–300\\nmore calories per day than they did in the 1970s. Moreover, as we\\nspend more time in front of computers, video games, TV, and other\\nelectronic pastimes, we have fewer hours available for physical activity.\\n24Your Guide to a Healthy Heart'),\n",

Take a look at the box on the next page.\\nYou’ll see that your weight in relation to your height gives you a\\nnumber called a Body Mass Index (BMI). A BMI from 18.5 to 24.9\\nindicates a normal weight.

The second step is to take your\\nwaist measurement. For women, a waist measurement of over 35\\ninches increases the risk of heart disease as well as the risks of high\\nblood pressure, diabetes, and other serious health conditions. For\\nmen, a waist measurement of more than 40 inches increases these\\nrisks. To measure your waist correctly, stand and place a tape meas-\\nure around your middle, just above your hipbones. Measure your\\nwaist just after you breathe out.\\nStep 3: Review your risk. The final step in determining your need to\\nlose weight is to find out your other risk factors for heart disease.\\nIt is important to know whether you have any of the following:\\nhigh blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol,\\nhigh triglycerides, high blood glucose (blood sugar), a family history\\nof heart disease, physical inactivity, or smoking.

You may want to work with a registered dietitian\\nto help you make these changes. A dietitian can teach you about the\\neating plan that is best for you, determine a reasonable calorie level,\\nand help you choose foods and plan menus. A dietitian can also help\\nyou keep track of your progress and encourage you to stay on your\\neating plan. Talk with your doctor about whether you should get a\\nreferral to a registered dietitian. In the meantime, if you have high\\nblood pressure or high blood cholesterol, here are some guidelines: \\nBlood Pressure and the DASH Eating Plan\\nIf you have high blood pressure or prehypertension, you may want\\nto follow an eating plan called DASH. DASH stands for “Dietary\\nApproaches to Stop Hypertension,” and the eating plan emphasizes\\nfruits, vegetables, whole-grain foods, and low-fat milk products.\\nIt is rich in magnesium, potassium, calcium, protein, and fiber, but\\nlow in saturated fat, trans fat, total fat, and cholesterol. It limits \\nred meat, sweets, and beverages with added sugars. In many ways,\\nDASH is similar to the TLC eating plan described on pages 53–55.\\nHowever, the DASH plan also encourages you to eat specific foods\\nrich in the nutrients noted above.\\nA major study found that people who followed this eating plan\\nreduced their blood pressure more than those who ate more “typical”\\nAmerican diets, which have fewer fruits and vegetables. A second\\nstudy found that people who followed the DASH eating plan and cut\\ndown on sodium had the biggest reductions in blood pressure. (Salt,\\nor sodium chloride, and other forms of sodium are found in many\\nprocessed foods. Often, more salt is added to food during cooking\\nand at the table.) So, for a truly winning combination, follow the\\nDASH eating plan and lower your sodium intake as much as possible.\\nThe study found that the less sodium people consumed, the more\\ntheir blood pressure dropped. (See ”The DASH Eating Plan” on\\npages 51–52and “Please Don’t Pass the Salt” on page 52.) \\nWhile the DASH eating plan is geared especially toward people with\\nhigh blood pressure or prehypertension, it is a healthy plan for\\neveryone. So share it with your family. When people with normal\\nblood pressure follow the DASH eating plan, especially when they\\nalso consume less sodium, they lessen their chances of developing\\nhigh blood pressure. Remember, 90 percent of middle-aged\\nAmericans go on to develop high blood pressure. Use the DASH\\nplan to help beat the odds! \\nYour Guide to a Healthy Heart'),\n",

Be creative!\\n● Don’t bring the salt shaker to the table. Try an herb substitute \\ninstead, such as powdered garlic, onion, or thyme. \\n● Use fresh poultry, fish, and lean meat, rather than canned, \\nsmoked, or processed types.\\n● Cut down on cured foods (such as bacon and ham), foods \\npacked in brine (such as pickles and olives), and condiments \\n(such as mustard, ketchup, barbeque sauce, and monosodium\\nglutamate). You should even limit lower sodium versions of \\nsoy sauce and teriyaki sauce.  \\n● Read the Nutrition Facts label on the food package and choose\\nconvenience foods that are lower in sodium. These foods \\ninclude frozen dinners, pizza, breads, packaged mixes, canned \\nsoups and broths, and salad dressings.\\n● Rinse canned foods, such as tuna and canned beans, to \\nremove some of the sodium.\\nWhile salt substitutes containing potassium chloride may be useful\\nfor some individuals, they can be harmful to people with certain\\nmedical conditions.

Here are some tips to help you succeed:\\nEat for health. Choose a wide variety of low-calorie, nutritious foods\\nin moderate amounts. Include vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and\\nlow-fat or fat-free milk, as well as fish, lean meat, poultry, or dry\\nbeans. Choose foods that are low in fat and added sugars. Choose\\nsensible portion sizes. (See “Portion Distortion” on page 68.) \\nWatch calories. To lose weight, most overweight people will need to\\ncut 500 to 1,000 calories per day from their current diet.\\nFor tips on choosing low-fat, low-calorie foods, see “The Substitution\\nSolution” on pages 66–67.\\nKeep milk on the menu. Don’t cut out milk products as you try to\\nreduce calories and fat. Milk and milk products are rich in calcium, \\na nutrient that helps prevent the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis.\\nInstead, choose low-fat or fat-free milk and milk products, which\\nhave the same amount of calcium as whole-milk products. Make the\\nswitch gradually. If you are used to drinking whole milk, first cut\\nback to 2 percent, then move to 1 percent, and finally to fat-free milk.\\nKeep moving. Physical activity is key to successful, long-term\\nweight loss. It can help you burn calories, trim extra fat from your\\nwaist, and control your appetite. It can also tone your muscles and\\nincrease aerobic fitness. To lose weight and to prevent further\\nweight gain, gradually build up to at least 60 minutes of moderate-\\nintensity physical activity on most, and preferably all, days of the\\nweek. If you’ve lost weight, in order to keep it off, you’ll need to \\ndo even more physical activity—from 60–90 minutes of daily mod-\\nerate-intensity physical activity. But you don’t need to run yourself\\nragged. A recent study showed that moderate physical activity, such\\nas brisk walking, helps people lose weight as effectively as more \\nvigorous exercise.

Show young kids how to clean fruits\\nand veggies and combine them into colorful salads. Let them make\\n“fruit-salad faces” out of sliced apples, bananas, and raisins. When\\nthey’re old enough, teach children to use the stove, oven, microwave,\\nand toaster safely. Show teens how to make simple, healthy dishes,\\nsuch as whole-grain pasta with vegetables and broiled chicken or\\nfish. Encourage them to be creative with herbs and spices. Children\\nwho have basic kitchen skills appreciate food more and are more\\nlikely to try new dishes.\\nGet them moving. The latest “Dietary Guidelines for Americans”\\nrecommend that children and teenagers be physically active for at\\nleast 60 minutes per day. Yet, in a world chock full of video games,\\nTV shows, and computer offerings, few young people are as active\\nas they should be. To encourage children to get off the couch, find\\nout what kinds of physical activities they do enjoy and make it easy\\nfor them to participate. If the kids in your family like to ride bikes,\\nplan a Sunday outing on your local trail. Walk, cycle, or jog with\\nthem to places close by. Use your backyard or local park to toss a\\nFrisbee around or to play a game of basketball, badminton, or vol-\\nleyball. Make an effort to gear activities to children’s ages. Younger\\nkids, up to age 10, tend to have quick bursts of energy sandwiched\\nbetween longer periods of rest, while older children usually have\\nmore endurance. Play down\\nthe competition, play up\\nthe fun, and pretty soon,\\nyour kids may start\\nasking you to\\nshoot some\\nhoops. Better\\nget in shape! \\nYour Guide to a Healthy Heart'),\n",

But, because heart health\\ninvolves changing daily habits, it can require some real effort. To\\nmake the process easier, try tackling only one habit at a time. For\\nexample, if you smoke cigarettes and also eat a diet high in saturat-\\ned fats, work first on kicking the smoking habit. Then, once you’ve\\nbecome comfortable as a nonsmoker, begin to skim the fat from\\nyour diet.\\nRemember, nobody’s perfect. Nobody always eats the ideal diet or\\ngets just the right amount of physical activity. The important thing\\nis to follow a sensible, realistic\\nplan that will gradually lessen\\nyour chances of developing\\nheart disease.\\nSo keep at it. Work\\nwith your doctor. Ask\\nfamily members and\\nfriends for support. If you\\nslip, try again.

Plaque is the accumulation of fat, cholesterol, and other\\nsubstances. As plaque continues to build up in the arteries, blood\\nflow to the heart is reduced.\\nHeart disease can lead to a heart attack. A heart attack happens\\nwhen an artery becomes totally blocked with plaque, preventing\\nvital oxygen and nutrients from getting to the heart. A heart attack\\ncan cause permanent damage to the heart muscle.\\nHeart disease is one of several cardiovascular diseases, which are\\ndisorders of the heart and blood vessel system. Other cardiovascular\\ndiseases include stroke, high blood pressure, and rheumatic heart\\ndisease.\\nSome people aren’t too concerned about heart disease because they\\nthink it can be “cured” with surgery. This is a myth.\\nHeart disease is a lifelong condition: Once you get it,\\nyou’ll always have it. It’s true that procedures such as\\nangioplasty and bypass surgery can help blood and\\noxygen flow more easily to the heart. But the arter-\\nies remain damaged, which means you are still more\\nlikely to have a heart attack. What’s more, the\\ncondition of your blood vessels will steadily\\nworsen unless you make changes in your\\ndaily habits and control your risk factors.\\nMany people die of complications\\nfrom heart disease, or become \\npermanently disabled.

They can also increase the chances that an\\nexisting disease will get worse. Important risk factors for heart dis-\\nease that you can do something about are cigarette smoking, high\\nblood pressure, high blood cholesterol, overweight, physical \\ninactivity, and diabetes. Recent research shows that more than \\n95 percent of those who die from heart disease have at least one \\nof these major risk factors.\\nCertain risk factors, such as getting older, can’t be changed. After\\nmenopause, women are more likely to develop heart disease. For\\nboth women and men, middle age is a time of increasing risk\\nbecause people are more likely to develop heart disease risk factors\\nduring this stage of life.\\nFamily history of early heart disease is another risk factor that can’t\\nbe changed. If your father or brother had a heart attack before age\\n55, or if your mother or sister had one before age 65, you are more\\nlikely to get heart disease.\\nWhile certain risk factors cannot be changed, it is important to \\nrealize that you do have control over many others. Regardless of\\nyour age or family history, you can take important steps to lower\\nyour risk of heart disease.\\nHow Risk Works\\nIt may be tempting to believe that doing just one healthy thing will\\ntake care of your heart disease risk. For example, you may hope\\nthat if you walk or swim regularly, you can still eat a lot of fatty\\nfoods and stay fairly healthy. Not true. To protect your heart, it is\\nvital to make changes that address each and every risk factor you\\nhave. You can make the changes gradually, one at a time. But mak-\\ning them is very important.\\nWhile each risk factor increases your risk of heart disease, having\\nmore than one risk factor is especially serious. That’s because risk\\nfactors tend to “gang up” and worsen each other’s effects. For\\nexample, if you have high blood cholesterol and you smoke, your\\nheart disease risk increases enormously. The message is clear: You\\nneed to take heart disease risk seriously, and the best time to reduce\\nthat risk is now.\\nYour Guide to a Healthy Heart'),\n",

Older individuals are at\\nhigher risk than younger people. Among older individuals, women\\nare more likely than men to develop high blood pressure. African\\nAmericans are more likely to develop high blood pressure, and at\\nearlier ages, than Whites. But nearly all of us are at risk, especially\\nas we grow older. Middle-aged Americans who don’t currently \\nhave high blood pressure have a 90-percent chance of eventually\\ndeveloping the disease.\\nHigh blood pressure is often called the silent killer because it \\nusually doesn’t cause symptoms.

However, your\\nbody makes all the cholesterol it needs. Over a period of years,\\nextra cholesterol and fat circulating in the blood build up in the\\nwalls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This buildup,\\ncalled plaque, makes the arteries narrower and narrower. As a\\nresult, less blood gets to the heart. Blood carries oxygen to the\\nheart; if enough oxygen-rich blood cannot reach your heart, you\\nmay suffer chest pain. If the blood supply to a portion of the heart\\nis completely cut off, the result is a heart attack.\\nCholesterol travels in the blood in packages called lipoproteins.\\nLDL carries most of the cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol pack-\\naged in LDL is often called bad cholesterol, because too high a level\\nof LDL in your blood can lead to cholesterol buildup and blockage\\nin your arteries.\\nAnother type of cholesterol is HDL, also called good cholesterol.\\nThat’s because HDL helps remove cholesterol from the body, \\npreventing it from building up in your arteries.\\n17Major Risk Factors'),\n",

These are the most commonly prescribed drugs for\\npeople who need a cholesterol-lowering medicine. Of all avail-\\nable medications, statins lower LDL cholesterol the most, usually\\nby 20 to 60 percent. Side effects are usually mild, although liver\\nand muscle problems occur rarely.

However, long-term use of these medicines is considered safe. \\nNiacin. Niacin, or nicotinic acid, lowers total cholesterol, LDL\\ncholesterol, and triglyceride levels, while also raising HDL \\ncholesterol. Niacin is available without a prescription, but it is\\nimportant to use it only under a doctor’s care because of possi-\\nble serious side effects. In some people, it may worsen peptic\\nulcers or cause liver problems, gout, or high blood sugar. \\nFibrates. These drugs can reduce triglycerides levels by 20 to\\n50 percent, while increasing HDL cholesterol by 10 to 15 percent.\\nFibrates are not very effective for lowering LDL cholesterol.

Groups at highest risk for obesity\\ninclude African American women, Mexican Americans, and\\nAmerican Indians, but millions of people from all backgrounds\\nweigh more than is healthy for them. Since 1991, the proportion \\nof Americans who are obese has soared by 75 percent.\\nOverweight among children is also swiftly increasing. Among young\\npeople ages 6–19, more than 16 percent are overweight, compared\\nto just 4 percent a few decades ago. This is a disturbing trend\\nbecause overweight adolescents have a greatly increased risk of\\ndying from heart disease in adulthood. Even our youngest citizens\\nare at risk. About 10 percent of preschoolers weigh more than is\\nhealthy for them.\\nOur national waistline is expanding for two simple reasons—we are\\neating more and moving less. Americans consume about 200–300\\nmore calories per day than they did in the 1970s. Moreover, as we\\nspend more time in front of computers, video games, TV, and other\\nelectronic pastimes, we have fewer hours available for physical activity.\\n24Your Guide to a Healthy Heart'),\n",

Take a look at the box on the next page.\\nYou’ll see that your weight in relation to your height gives you a\\nnumber called a Body Mass Index (BMI). A BMI from 18.5 to 24.9\\nindicates a normal weight.

The second step is to take your\\nwaist measurement. For women, a waist measurement of over 35\\ninches increases the risk of heart disease as well as the risks of high\\nblood pressure, diabetes, and other serious health conditions. For\\nmen, a waist measurement of more than 40 inches increases these\\nrisks. To measure your waist correctly, stand and place a tape meas-\\nure around your middle, just above your hipbones. Measure your\\nwaist just after you breathe out.\\nStep 3: Review your risk. The final step in determining your need to\\nlose weight is to find out your other risk factors for heart disease.\\nIt is important to know whether you have any of the following:\\nhigh blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol,\\nhigh triglycerides, high blood glucose (blood sugar), a family history\\nof heart disease, physical inactivity, or smoking.

Type 2 diabetes also is more common among American\\nIndians, Hispanic Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans,\\nand Pacific Islanders. Women who have had diabetes during preg-\\nnancy (gestational diabetes) or have given birth to a baby weighing\\nmore than 9 pounds are also more likely to develop type 2 diabetes\\nlater in life.\\nSymptoms of diabetes may include fatigue, nausea, frequent urination,\\nunusual thirst, weight loss, blurred vision, frequent infections, and\\nslow healing of sores. But type 2 diabetes develops gradually and\\nsometimes has no symptoms. Even if you have no symptoms of \\ndiabetes, if you are overweight and have any of the risk factors for\\ntype 2 diabetes, ask your doctor about getting tested for it. You have\\ndiabetes if your fasting blood glucose level is 126 mg/dL or higher.\\nIf you have diabetes, controlling your blood glucose (blood sugar)\\nlevels will help to prevent complications. Because diabetes is so\\nstrongly linked with heart disease, managing diabetes must include\\nkeeping certain factors under control. (See “The ABCs of Diabetes\\nControl.”) Recommended levels of blood pressure and blood choles-\\nterol control are lower for people with diabetes than for most oth-\\ners. Not smoking, being physically active, and taking aspirin daily\\n(if your doctor recommends it) also are important ways to prevent\\nheart disease if you have diabetes.\\nSome people do not yet have diabetes, but are at high risk for devel-\\noping the disease. More than 14 million Americans have a condition\\nknown as “prediabetes,” in which blood glucose levels are higher\\nthan normal but not yet in the diabetic range. Prediabetes is defined\\nas a fasting blood glucose level of 100–125 mg/dL. New research\\nshows that many people with prediabetes can prevent or delay the\\ndevelopment of diabetes by making modest changes in diet and level\\nof physical activity. (See “Preventing Diabetes.”) \\nPeople who are prediabetic also have a 50 percent greater chance \\nof having a heart attack or stroke than those with normal blood \\nglucose levels. If you are prediabetic, you’ll need to pay close \\nattention to preventing or controlling high blood pressure, high\\nblood cholesterol, and other risk factors for heart disease.'),\n",

You may want to work with a registered dietitian\\nto help you make these changes. A dietitian can teach you about the\\neating plan that is best for you, determine a reasonable calorie level,\\nand help you choose foods and plan menus. A dietitian can also help\\nyou keep track of your progress and encourage you to stay on your\\neating plan. Talk with your doctor about whether you should get a\\nreferral to a registered dietitian. In the meantime, if you have high\\nblood pressure or high blood cholesterol, here are some guidelines: \\nBlood Pressure and the DASH Eating Plan\\nIf you have high blood pressure or prehypertension, you may want\\nto follow an eating plan called DASH. DASH stands for “Dietary\\nApproaches to Stop Hypertension,” and the eating plan emphasizes\\nfruits, vegetables, whole-grain foods, and low-fat milk products.\\nIt is rich in magnesium, potassium, calcium, protein, and fiber, but\\nlow in saturated fat, trans fat, total fat, and cholesterol. It limits \\nred meat, sweets, and beverages with added sugars. In many ways,\\nDASH is similar to the TLC eating plan described on pages 53–55.\\nHowever, the DASH plan also encourages you to eat specific foods\\nrich in the nutrients noted above.\\nA major study found that people who followed this eating plan\\nreduced their blood pressure more than those who ate more “typical”\\nAmerican diets, which have fewer fruits and vegetables. A second\\nstudy found that people who followed the DASH eating plan and cut\\ndown on sodium had the biggest reductions in blood pressure. (Salt,\\nor sodium chloride, and other forms of sodium are found in many\\nprocessed foods. Often, more salt is added to food during cooking\\nand at the table.) So, for a truly winning combination, follow the\\nDASH eating plan and lower your sodium intake as much as possible.\\nThe study found that the less sodium people consumed, the more\\ntheir blood pressure dropped. (See ”The DASH Eating Plan” on\\npages 51–52and “Please Don’t Pass the Salt” on page 52.) \\nWhile the DASH eating plan is geared especially toward people with\\nhigh blood pressure or prehypertension, it is a healthy plan for\\neveryone. So share it with your family. When people with normal\\nblood pressure follow the DASH eating plan, especially when they\\nalso consume less sodium, they lessen their chances of developing\\nhigh blood pressure. Remember, 90 percent of middle-aged\\nAmericans go on to develop high blood pressure. Use the DASH\\nplan to help beat the odds! \\nYour Guide to a Healthy Heart'),\n",

Be creative!\\n● Don’t bring the salt shaker to the table. Try an herb substitute \\ninstead, such as powdered garlic, onion, or thyme. \\n● Use fresh poultry, fish, and lean meat, rather than canned, \\nsmoked, or processed types.\\n● Cut down on cured foods (such as bacon and ham), foods \\npacked in brine (such as pickles and olives), and condiments \\n(such as mustard, ketchup, barbeque sauce, and monosodium\\nglutamate). You should even limit lower sodium versions of \\nsoy sauce and teriyaki sauce.  \\n● Read the Nutrition Facts label on the food package and choose\\nconvenience foods that are lower in sodium. These foods \\ninclude frozen dinners, pizza, breads, packaged mixes, canned \\nsoups and broths, and salad dressings.\\n● Rinse canned foods, such as tuna and canned beans, to \\nremove some of the sodium.\\nWhile salt substitutes containing potassium chloride may be useful\\nfor some individuals, they can be harmful to people with certain\\nmedical conditions.

Here are some tips to help you succeed:\\nEat for health. Choose a wide variety of low-calorie, nutritious foods\\nin moderate amounts. Include vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and\\nlow-fat or fat-free milk, as well as fish, lean meat, poultry, or dry\\nbeans. Choose foods that are low in fat and added sugars. Choose\\nsensible portion sizes. (See “Portion Distortion” on page 68.) \\nWatch calories. To lose weight, most overweight people will need to\\ncut 500 to 1,000 calories per day from their current diet.\\nFor tips on choosing low-fat, low-calorie foods, see “The Substitution\\nSolution” on pages 66–67.\\nKeep milk on the menu. Don’t cut out milk products as you try to\\nreduce calories and fat. Milk and milk products are rich in calcium, \\na nutrient that helps prevent the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis.\\nInstead, choose low-fat or fat-free milk and milk products, which\\nhave the same amount of calcium as whole-milk products. Make the\\nswitch gradually. If you are used to drinking whole milk, first cut\\nback to 2 percent, then move to 1 percent, and finally to fat-free milk.\\nKeep moving. Physical activity is key to successful, long-term\\nweight loss. It can help you burn calories, trim extra fat from your\\nwaist, and control your appetite. It can also tone your muscles and\\nincrease aerobic fitness. To lose weight and to prevent further\\nweight gain, gradually build up to at least 60 minutes of moderate-\\nintensity physical activity on most, and preferably all, days of the\\nweek. If you’ve lost weight, in order to keep it off, you’ll need to \\ndo even more physical activity—from 60–90 minutes of daily mod-\\nerate-intensity physical activity. But you don’t need to run yourself\\nragged. A recent study showed that moderate physical activity, such\\nas brisk walking, helps people lose weight as effectively as more \\nvigorous exercise.

Show young kids how to clean fruits\\nand veggies and combine them into colorful salads. Let them make\\n“fruit-salad faces” out of sliced apples, bananas, and raisins. When\\nthey’re old enough, teach children to use the stove, oven, microwave,\\nand toaster safely. Show teens how to make simple, healthy dishes,\\nsuch as whole-grain pasta with vegetables and broiled chicken or\\nfish. Encourage them to be creative with herbs and spices. Children\\nwho have basic kitchen skills appreciate food more and are more\\nlikely to try new dishes.\\nGet them moving. The latest “Dietary Guidelines for Americans”\\nrecommend that children and teenagers be physically active for at\\nleast 60 minutes per day. Yet, in a world chock full of video games,\\nTV shows, and computer offerings, few young people are as active\\nas they should be. To encourage children to get off the couch, find\\nout what kinds of physical activities they do enjoy and make it easy\\nfor them to participate. If the kids in your family like to ride bikes,\\nplan a Sunday outing on your local trail. Walk, cycle, or jog with\\nthem to places close by. Use your backyard or local park to toss a\\nFrisbee around or to play a game of basketball, badminton, or vol-\\nleyball. Make an effort to gear activities to children’s ages. Younger\\nkids, up to age 10, tend to have quick bursts of energy sandwiched\\nbetween longer periods of rest, while older children usually have\\nmore endurance.

However, super-\\ncapacitors have low energy density.\\nBatteries and supercapacitors both rely \\non electrochemical processes, although sepa-\\nrate electrochemical mechanisms determine \\ntheir relative energy and power density. Dur-\\ning the past 5 to 7 years, the energy storage \\nﬁ  eld has witnessed a dramatic expansion in \\nresearch directed at materials that might com-\\nbine the high energy density of batteries with \\nthe long cycle life and short charging times \\nof supercapacitors ( 2). However, the blurring \\nof these two electrochemical approaches can \\ncause confusion and may lead to unwarranted \\nclaims unless careful attention is paid to fun-\\ndamental performance characteristics.\\nThe electrochemical processes occurring \\nin batteries and supercapacitors give rise to \\ntheir different charge-storage properties. In \\nlithium ion (Li+) batteries, the insertion of Li+ \\nthat enables redox reactions in bulk electrode \\nmaterials is diffusion-controlled and can be \\nslow. Supercapacitor devices, also known as \\nelectrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), \\nstore charge by adsorption of electrolyte ions \\nonto the surface of electrode materials (see \\nthe ﬁ  gure, panels A to D). No redox reactions \\nare required, so the response to changes in \\npotential without diffusion limitations is rapid \\nand leads to high power. However, the charge \\nis conﬁ  ned to the surface, so the energy den-\\nsity of EDLCs is less than that of batteries ( 3). \\nAs shown in the ﬁ  gure, panels E to H, super-\\ncapacitors can be distinguished from batter-\\nies by both potentiostatic and galvanostatic \\nmethods. The different methods for achieving \\ndouble-layer capacitance are characterized \\nby classic rectangular cyclic voltammograms \\n(panel E) and a linear time-dependent change \\nin potential at a constant current (panel G). In \\nbatteries, the cyclic voltammograms are char-\\nacterized by faradaic redox peaks, often with \\nrather large voltage separation (greater than \\n0.1 to 0.2 V) between oxidation and reduc-\\ntion because of phase transitions (panel F) \\n( 4). The presence of two phases is indicated \\nby the voltage plateau in galvanostatic experi-\\nments (panel H).\\nIn the 1970s, Conway and others recog-\\nnized that reversible redox reactions occur-\\nring at or near the surface of an appropri-\\nate electrode material lead to EDLC-like \\nelectrochemical features but the redox pro-\\ncesses lead to much greater charge storage \\nWhere Do Batteries End \\nand Supercapacitors Begin?\\nMATERIALS SCIENCE\\nPatrice Simon ,1 Yury Gogotsi ,2 Bruce Dunn, 3  \\nElectrochemical measurements can distinguish \\nbetween different types of energy storage \\nmaterials and their underlying mechanisms.\\n1Université Paul Sabatier–Toulouse III, CIRIMAT UMR-CNRS \\n5085, and RS2E, FR CNRS 3459, 118 Route de Narbonne,  \\n31062 Toulouse, France. 2Department of Materials Science \\nand Engineering and A.

This pseudocapacitance represents a sec-\\nond mechanism for capacitive energy stor-\\nage. The most widely known pseudocapaci-\\ntors are RuO2 and MnO2; recently this list has \\nexpanded to other oxides, as well as nitrides \\nand carbides, as different pseudocapacitance \\nmechanisms have been identiﬁ  ed ( 6). Pseu-\\ndocapacitive materials hold the promise of \\nachieving battery-level energy density com-\\nbined with the cycle life and power density \\nof EDLCs. To avoid further confusion with \\nEDLCs, we propose that these materials be \\ncalled oxide supercapacitors (nitride, carbide, \\netc.) to recognize that a substantial fraction \\nof the charge storage arises from redox reac-\\ntions. The use of this terminology requires \\nidentifying the charge storage mechanism, \\nrather than basing the claim on the material \\ntype alone.\\nA second feature that blurs the distinction \\nbetween batteries and supercapacitors is how \\ntheir response changes when nanoscale mate-\\nrials are used. When battery materials are pre-\\npared in nanoscale forms, their power density \\nincreases because of the short transport paths \\nfor ions and electrons ( 7). However, increased \\npower density does not necessarily transform \\nnanoscale materials into oxide supercapaci-\\ntors because their faradaic redox peaks and \\ngalvanostatic profiles remain battery-like \\n(see the ﬁ  gure, panels F and H). At smaller \\ndimensions (<10 nm), there are indications \\nthat traditional battery materials exhibit \\ncapacitor-like properties [e.g., LiCoO2 shown \\nin panel H of the ﬁ  gure ( 8); V2O5 may behave \\nin a similar fashion ( 9)]. “Extrinsic” pseudo-\\ncapacitance can emerge when a battery mate-\\nrial is engineered at the nanoscale so that a \\nlarge fraction of Li+ storage sites are on the \\nsurface or near-surface region.\\nPronounced redox peaks in the voltam-\\nmetry can be an indication of pseudocapaci-\\ntance, provided the peak voltage differences \\nare small and remain so with increasing sweep \\nrate ( 5). The kinetic information obtained \\nfrom sweep voltammetry can also be used. \\nFor a redox reaction limited by semi-inﬁ  nite \\ndiffusion, the peak current i varies as v1/2; for \\na capacitive process, it varies as v. This rela-\\ntion is expressed as i = avb ( 10), with the value \\nof b providing insight regarding the charge \\nstorage mechanism. Over a wide range of \\nsweep rates v, the well-known battery mate-\\nrial LiFePO4 has b ≈ 0.5, whereas b ≈ 1.0 for \\nthe pseudocapacitor material Nb2O5 ( 6,  11). \\nIn addition to diffusion-controlled behavior, \\nlow Coulombic efﬁ  ciency and sluggish kinet-\\nics are indications that the material is not a \\nsupercapacitor. Thus, an electrode material \\nor a device with well-separated redox peaks \\n(panel F) and a discharge curve similar to the \\nupper curve in panel H should not be consid-\\nered a supercapacitor.\\nThere is nothing inappropriate in using \\nnanostructured battery materials in symmet-\\nric electrochemical cells or combined with \\na capacitive electrode (carbon) to make a \\nhybrid energy storage device. However, it is \\nmisleading to test such a material or device \\nat a low rate (for a supercapacitor, at least) \\nand claim that it is a “high–\\nenergy density superca-\\npacitor.” Additionally, the \\nuse of low weight load-\\nings or thin ﬁ  lms of nano-\\nstructured battery materi-\\nals leads to devices with \\nmoderate performance \\nand limited cycle life ( 12). \\nIf the materials are to be \\nconsidered for high-power \\ndevices, they need to be \\nevaluated at the rates where \\nsupercapacitor devices are \\nused (e.g., fully recharged \\nin 1 min, referred to as a \\nrate of 60C).\\nThe prospect of devel-\\noping materials with the \\nenergy density of batteries \\nand the power density and \\ncycle life of supercapaci-\\ntors is an exciting direction \\nthat has yet to be realized. \\nWhether to approach these \\ngoals by increasing the \\npower density of battery materials or increas-\\ning the energy density of supercapacitors is \\none of the enticing features of the ﬁ  eld. How-\\never, there needs to be clarity in the terminol-\\nogy used in combination with appropriate \\nmeasurements and analyses. Proper evalua-\\ntion of new materials and their charge storage \\nmechanisms will facilitate progress in this \\nimportant ﬁ  eld of electrical energy storage. \\nReferences and Notes\\n 1. J. R.

(A to D) The different mechanisms of capacitive energy storage are illustrated. Dou-\\nble-layer capacitance develops at electrodes comprising (A) carbon particles or (B) porous carbon. The double layer shown here \\narises from adsorption of negative ions from the electrolyte on the positively charged electrode. Pseudocapacitive mechanisms \\ninclude (C) redox pseudocapacitance, as occurs in hydrous RuO 2, and (D) intercalation pseudocapacitance, where Li + ions are \\ninserted into the host material. (E to H) Electrochemical characteristics distinguish capacitor and battery materials. Cyclic voltam-\\nmograms distinguish a capacitor material where the response to a linear change in potential is a constant current (E), as compared \\nto a battery material, which exhibits faradaic redox peaks (F). Galvanostatic discharge behavior (where Q is charge) for a MnO2 pseu-\\ndocapacitor is linear for both bulk and nanoscale material (G) ( 13,  14), but a LiCoO2 nanoscale material exhibits a linear response \\nwhile the bulk material shows a voltage plateau (H) ( 8).\\nCREDIT: ADAPTED FROM KRISTY JOST/DREXEL 10.1126/science.1249625\\nPublished by AAAS\\non October 11, 2018 http://science.sciencemag.org/Downloaded from'),\n",
